# Project Idea
- The idea of the project is to recreate an Instagram replica with one single post 
- The goals for the projects are to use semantic HTML in order to make the project accessible, to recreate the post only with HTML and CSS vanilla and to add hover effects on the buttons

# Stretch Goals
- Implement all 3 posts using JS 
- Increase the likes when the button is pressed and also the opposite
